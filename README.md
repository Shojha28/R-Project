# R-Project
Heart Failure Prediction and Analysis – R Aug 2023 – Nov 2023 
• Building a classification model using R that accurately assesses whether an individual is at elevated risk of experiencing a
heart attack or not.
• Employed machine learning techniques such as Random Forest Tree, Logistic Regression, Decision/Classification Tree, and 
Neural Network to identify high-risk of heart attacks and achieved a predictive accuracy of 88% in assessing the likelihood 
of a heart attack.
• Employed linear regression to predict quantitative outcomes related to heart health, such as blood pressure or cholesterol 
levels and to estimate the impact of interventions or lifestyle changes on heart health
